# Report for Week 3 (2024-02-04 - 2024-02-10)

## Project Initialization: Creating New Directories and .cpp Files
To kickstart the project, I initiated the process by generating new directories and crafting the necessary .cpp files.

## Data Selection for Hash Collision Testing

In order to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our hash collision functions, I have carefully chosen four distinct datasets for testing. Each dataset serves a specific purpose and contributes to a more comprehensive assessment of the hash functions. These datasets are documented in the `README` file located in the newly created `Data` directory. Below, I provide a brief overview of each dataset selection:

1. **Ordered Data**: This dataset consists of sequentially ordered values. 
It is chosen to assess how well the hash functions perform when the input data is structured and predictable.

2. **Random Data**: Randomized data provides a realistic representation of unpredictable input. 
Testing with this dataset helps ensure the hash functions can handle various data distributions.

3. **Real-World Data**: Real-world datasets are drawn from actual scenarios, such as customer records or product information. 
Using this dataset allows us to evaluate the hash functions' performance with practical, diverse data.

4. **Repeating Data**: Repeating data is composed of values that occur multiple times. 
Testing with this dataset aims to investigate how our hash functions handle duplicate entries, which is a common occurrence in many applications.
