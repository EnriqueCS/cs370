# Meeting 1 Recap

## Overview
- The Python code currently used for hashing algorithms will be utilized to ensure correctness.
- Our objective is to transition the implementation of hashing algorithms to C/C++ for enhanced performance.

## Action Items
- **Develop a suite of tests** for evaluating the hashing algorithms. These tests will be crucial in assessing the algorithms' effectiveness and performance.
- **Consultation**: Reach out to Professor David Wu, a specialist in Cryptography, for insights on suitable tests for the hashing algorithms and for additional knowledge on hash functions. Note that he was unavailable last Friday due to other commitments. An email will be sent to schedule a meeting with him.
- **Review and Prioritize**: The TikTok paper should be considered a lower priority. The focus, for now, should be on finalizing the tests for the algorithms and beginning to compile robust data.
- **Literature Review**: Continue to review additional papers to deepen our understanding and to inform our approach.

## Priorities Before Next Meeting
1. Complete the development and validation of all tests for the hashing algorithms.
2. Begin gathering solid data based on these tests.
3. Further review of relevant literature to inform our understanding and approach.

## Main Goal
- To analyze and understand the trade-offs between different hashing algorithms, guiding our implementation strategy moving forward. This includes considering more complex hashing algorithms in exchange for improved distribution of data, ensuring a balance between algorithm complexity and data handling efficiency.
