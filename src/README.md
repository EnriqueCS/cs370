- **Data**: We store our input data for testing the algorithms in this directory. It's organized to help us thoroughly test each algorithm's performance in different situations, helping us make them better.

- **Results**: This is where we keep the outcomes of our tests, in .json format. It's essential for looking at how our algorithms perform and understanding their strengths and weaknesses.
