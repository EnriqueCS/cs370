# Directory Overview

This section offers a detailed overview of each directory and file within our project, highlighting their significance and role in the overall architecture. Our structured approach aims to streamline navigation and understanding, enabling efficient project management and development.

- **Algorithms**: This directory houses the core implementation of our hashing algorithms. It serves as the foundation of our project, where the theoretical aspects of hashing are translated into practical, executable code.

- **Executables**: Automatically managed by the Makefile, this directory contains the compiled binaries or scripts ready for execution. Users need not interact directly with this directory, as the Makefile orchestrates the compilation and execution processes seamlessly.

- **PolishedResults**: Dedicated to the visual representation of our data, this directory contains graphs, charts, and other visual aids. These visualizations provide insightful perspectives on the performance and efficiency of the hashing algorithms, making complex data more accessible.

- **ResultProcessing**: A critical step in our workflow, this directory's scripts and tools process raw results into a format suitable for analysis and visualization. This processing is pivotal for extracting meaningful insights from the data collected during testing.

- **Sanity_Checks**: Contains tests that verify the fundamental correctness and stability of the hashing algorithms. These sanity checks are crucial for ensuring that the algorithms behave as expected under various conditions.

- **Testing**: This directory hosts the main testing code for our hashing algorithms. It includes a comprehensive suite of tests designed to rigorously evaluate the algorithms' performance, resilience, and scalability.

- **log.txt**: A comprehensive file capturing all output from the Makefile executions. It serves as a valuable log for troubleshooting, auditing, and understanding the build and execution processes.

- **Makefile**: At the heart of our project's automation, the Makefile simplifies complex build and execution tasks into manageable commands. A glance at the Makefile offers insights into the project's build system and dependencies, facilitating easier project management.

- **Data**: The repository for input data used in algorithm testing. Organized meticulously to cover a broad spectrum of scenarios, this directory is instrumental in thoroughly assessing each algorithm's performance across diverse conditions.

- **Results**: Stores the outcomes of our algorithm tests in .json format. This structured storage is vital for subsequent analysis, enabling a deep dive into the algorithms' performance metrics to discern their strengths and potential areas for improvement.
