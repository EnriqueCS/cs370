# Project Structure Overview

This document is your guide to the structure of our project's directory. It's here to help you find your way around the different folders and understand what each one contains. This way, you can easily get involved and contribute.

- **googletest**: Here, you'll find files for Google's testing framework. We use it to run automated tests, making sure our code is both high-quality and reliable.

- **src**: This folder is all about hashing algorithms. It's where we keep the source code, documentation, and tests for each algorithm. It's key for developing and testing our algorithms to make sure they work well.

- **no-code**: Not everything in our project is about code. This section has documents and notes that capture our thinking and decision-making process. It's a great resource for understanding the why behind our project.
