# Project Structure Overview

This project is organized into three primary directories: `Monolith`, `Readings`, and `Syllabus`. Each directory serves a distinct purpose in the context of the project.

## Directories

- **Monolith**: Contains core project files. A separate `README.md` within this folder explains the specific rationale behind its structure. Note that some large files in the `Monolith` directory are not included in the repository due to their size but are present on my local machine.

- **Readings**: Includes materials and resources for reference.

- **Syllabus**: Outlines the scope of the project and the timeline for its implementation.
