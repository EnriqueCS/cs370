# Project Structure Overview

This project is organized into four primary directories: `Monolith`, `Readings`, `Syllabus`, and `WeeklyReports`. Each directory serves a distinct purpose in the context of the project.

## Directories

- **Monolith**: Contains core project files. A separate `README.md` within this folder explains the specific rationale behind its structure. Note that some large files in the `Monolith` directory are not included in the repository due to their size but are present on my local machine.

- **Readings**: Includes materials and resources for reference.

- **Syllabus**: Outlines the scope of the project and the timeline for its implementation.

- **WeeklyReports**: This directory holds the weekly progress reports of the project. Each report, named in the format `MMReportDD-DD.md`, provides a comprehensive overview of the developments, challenges, and any significant changes in the project's trajectory for that week. These reports are vital for tracking the project's progress and ensuring alignment with the project goals and timelines.
