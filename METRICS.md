# Potential Metrics for Evaluating Hashing Algorithms

When assessing hashing algorithms on modern computing systems, particularly for large tables, it's crucial to consider the following architectural effects:

- **Cache Utilization**: Performance is heavily influenced by how algorithms leverage the cache hierarchy. Effective cache use minimizes cache misses, enhancing speed.

- **Memory Bandwidth**: Algorithms need to efficiently manage memory bandwidth. Optimizing data movements can lead to better performance due to minimized bandwidth bottlenecks.

- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: The ability to exploit multicore processors through parallel execution paths significantly affects performance. This involves efficient synchronization and data sharing across cores.

- **Instruction-Level Efficiency**: The match between algorithm operations and the processor's instruction set can accelerate performance, especially if specialized instructions are utilized.

- **Memory Access Patterns**: Favoring sequential over random access and exploiting locality of reference can improve performance by better aligning with memory hierarchy.

- **Large Table Handling**: The algorithm's approach to managing very large tables impacts performance, particularly in terms of scaling, memory overhead, and minimizing cache thrashing.

These metrics collectively provide a framework for evaluating the space-time tradeoffs of hashing algorithms in the context of modern computing architectures.
