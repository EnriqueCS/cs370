## Types of Data for Testing
### 1. Random Data
You should test how the hashing algorithm performs with completely random data. Random data is useful for evaluating the algorithm's basic properties, such as uniformity and collision resistance.

### 2. Ordered Data
Testing with ordered data helps assess whether the algorithm exhibits any patterns or biases when hashing sequentially increasing or decreasing values.

### 3. Repeating Data
Check how the algorithm handles repeated values or patterns within the data. This is essential for collision resistance testing.

### 4. Real-world Data
Use real-world data sets relevant to your application domain. For example, if you're building a file deduplication system, test with actual files to see how the algorithm behaves with typical input.
